## Project Overview
**Project:** Advanced Threat Actor Profiling  
**Analyst:** Nyerovwo Obarueroro  
**Date:** November 18, 2025  
**Threat Level:** High  

## Executive Summary

Scattered Spider represents one of the most sophisticated cybercriminal threats targeting enterprises today. This English-speaking group, composed mainly of individuals aged 16-25, has evolved from basic credential theft to executing high-impact ransomware attacks across multiple sectors including hospitality, retail, telecommunications, and critical infrastructure.

Their unique ability to bypass multi-factor authentication through advanced social engineering makes them a "post-MFA" threat actor that requires immediate defensive attention.

## Threat Actor Profile

| **Attribute** | **Details** |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Primary Aliases** | UNC3944, Muddled Libra, Octo Tempest, StarFraud, Scatter Swin |
| **Type** | Financially motivated cybercriminal group / Ransomware affiliate |
| **Motivation** | Financial gain through ransomware operations and data extortion |
| **Target Sectors** | Hospitality, Entertainment, Retail, Telecommunications, Technology, Financial Services, MSPs |
| **Operational Focus** | Social engineering, identity system compromise, initial access brokerage |

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Tactic | Technique ID | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Reconnaissance | T1589.001 | Gather Victim Identity Information |
| Initial Access | T1660 | Social Engineering via SMS phishing |
| Credential Access | T1621 | Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation |

| Lateral Movement | T1021.001 | Remote Desktop Protocol |
| Persistence | T1087 | Cloud Accounts |
| Impact | T1486 | Data Encrypted for Impact |

## MISP Implementation

- ✅ Created dedicated Scattered Spider event
- ✅ Imported all IOCs via Freetext Import
- ✅ Applied `OSINT:Scattered-Spider` taxonomy tags
- ✅ Mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- ✅ Published for correlation and analysis

## Detection Recommendations

### 1. Identity & Access Controls
- Enforce phishing-resistant MFA across all accounts
- Monitor for suspicious authentication patterns
- Alert on MFA reset/enrollment modifications

### 2. Endpoint Security
- Restrict RMM tools (AnyDesk, TeamViewer, Splashtop)
- Monitor for unusual RDP connections
- Implement application allowlisting

### 3. Network Monitoring
- Block known malicious IPs and domains
- DNS filtering for phishing domains
- Monitor for data exfiltration patterns

### 4. Cloud Security
- Monitor SaaS configuration changes
- Alert on unusual API calls in cloud environments
- Restrict legacy authentication protocols

## SOC Alerting Strategy

```yaml
High Priority Alerts:
  - Multiple MFA push notifications in short timeframe
  - RDP connections from unknown IP ranges
  - Suspicious cloud tenant configuration changes
  - Data transfers to known malicious IPs
  
Medium Priority Alerts:
  - New device registrations in identity providers
  - Unusual remote management tool usage
  - Access to sensitive data stores from new locations
```

## Conclusion

Scattered Spider represents a persistent and adaptive threat in the cybersecurity landscape. Their demonstrated ability to consistently bypass multi-factor authentication and execute sophisticated social engineering attacks positions them as a highly dangerous, "post-MFA" adversary.

Defending against this advanced threat requires a proactive and layered security approach. Organizations must move beyond conventional perimeter defenses and assume determined adversaries will breach standard controls. The recommendations outlined in this report provide a critical framework for building resilience against this sophisticated threat actor.
